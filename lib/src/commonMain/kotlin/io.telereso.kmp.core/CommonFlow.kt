/**
 * A wrapper class for Kotlin Coroutine Flows for iOS.
 * This is picked up from jetbrain's kotlinconf FlowUtils.
 * So instead of flow, we only have callbacks that looks almost like a flow,
 * It also exposes a Closeable. that is responsible for closing any scope we have on Kotlin side. so client can simple call close().
 * this creates a lifecycle flow we can deal with.
 * it enables iOS and web to consume the flow data in a natural way.
 * refer to the iOS and web samples for how to use.
 * launchIn defines where we running our coroutine. here its running on Dispatchers.Main so this may cause issue with
 * Threading controlled on Kotlin KMM. e.g in case the client want to run this flow in a Dispatchers background it will still run on Main. but will explorer this some other time.
 *
 * If the Flow is wrapped in a Task and using CoroutineExceptionHandler we can grab the throws without crash
 * but what if the Flow is not using a wrapper, it's causing a crashes.
 * Here we added a way to catch any errors during the streaming of flows and send it as a callback
 * to the client.
 *
 * Note: Android should use collect instead of watch and handle errors by using try/catch or CoroutineExceptionHandler
 * and on iOS adn web we are able to get a error value with readable Exception of what went wrong.
